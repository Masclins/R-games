# R-games

The point of this project is to give an enjoyable way to practice R programming.

For each game there will be a folder with a README including the rules.

## Run Games

All games (right now) use the same `play.R` script, for which you'll need to pass, as an argument, the directory of the wanted game.
> e.g: `Rscript play.R ~/R-games/SPB`
